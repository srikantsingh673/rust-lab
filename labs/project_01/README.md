# Project_01

**Hypothesis :** Try to integrate Rust with Python to improve performance for computationally intensive tasks.

**Benchmark Criteria :** Measure execution time and memory usage of Python-only vs. Rust-accelerated implementations for the same computational tasks.

- Arithmetic Operations
- String Processing
- List Manipulation
- File I/O


1. **Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

   From the `labs/project_01` directory, run:
   
2. **Install requirements**

   With the virtual environment activated, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Build and install the Rust extension**

   In the same `labs/project_01` directory, run:
   ```bash
   maturin develop
   ```


4. **Run the Python file**

   Still in `labs/project_01`, run:
   ```bash
   python src/exp.py
   ```

## Output Directory Overview

The `output/` directory contains all benchmark results, statistics, and generated files:

- **result.csv**: Raw benchmark results for each function and implementation (Python and Rust), including multiple runs.
- **summary_results.csv**: Aggregated statistics for each function, including mean execution time, standard deviation, and speedup ratio (Python ÷ Rust).
- **detailed_statistics.csv**: Detailed statistics (mean, std, min, max, quartiles) for each function and implementation.
- **py_output.txt**: Example output file generated by the Python file I/O benchmark.
- **rs_output.txt**: Example output file generated by the Rust file I/O benchmark.
- **benchmark_results.png**: Bar chart comparing average execution times for Python and Rust, with RDS (Relative Difference Score) annotated for each function.
- **average_execution_time.png**: Visualization of average execution times (may be similar to benchmark_results.png).
- **execution_time_distribution.png**: Distribution plot of execution times for each function/implementation.
- **execution_time_stability.png**: Visualization of execution time stability (e.g., std deviation across runs).
- **python_to_rust_speed_ratio.png**: Chart showing the speedup ratio (Python time divided by Rust time) for each function.

### Key Analytics & Findings

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Rust is about 2x faster than Python (Speedup ≈ 2.1).
- **File I/O:** Python is faster than Rust for this benchmark (Speedup ≈ 0.27).
- **List Manipulation:** Python and Rust are similar, with Python slightly faster (Speedup ≈ 0.89).
- **String Processing:** Python is much faster than Rust for this task (Speedup ≈ 0.13).

**Relative Difference Score (RDS):**
RDS quantifies the relative timing difference between Python and Rust for each function. Higher RDS means a larger performance gap.

| Function               | Python (s) | Rust (s) | Speedup (Py÷Rust) | RDS    |
|------------------------|------------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| arithmetic_operations  | 0.88       | 0.42     | 2.11              | 1.11   |
| file_io                | 0.62       | 2.26     | 0.27              | 2.65   |
| list_manipulation      | 0.06       | 0.07     | 0.89              | 0.12   |
| string_processing      | 0.56       | 4.47     | 0.13              | 6.93   |


See the output images for visual comparisons and further insights.

This will build the Rust extension and run the provided Python script (`src/exp.py`) that uses the Rust code. All commands should be run from the `labs/project_01` directory, and it is recommended to use the `.venv` virtual environment for isolation.
